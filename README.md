# Readme
Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Arsalan akhter and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder.
