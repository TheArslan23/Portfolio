# Readme
Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Arsalan akhter and I am excited to have you here!
In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
I am currently interning as a Market Consultant at Stiddle where my primary job is to write content for the company’s website, email marketing campaigns, social media campaigns, etc. I had the opportunity to practice my data-related skills by gathering and analyzing from various online sources to suggest relevant topics to write and potential industries/locations to target for our social media campaigns. Now, I am taking on a more analytical role in the company where I’m currently analyzing the eCommerce market.

 I became mesmerized with data after learning how raw data was utilized by the United States to turn the tide of the war at the Battle of Midway in favor of the Allies. Prior to this, I have taken quantitative focused courses such as statistics, linear algebra, R, etc. After exploring the use of data more in different industries such as marketing, healthcare and finance, I officially began my data education with Udacity with their Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program. The most recent topic that I’ve learned is how to build a Machine Learning pipeline and make recommendation engines from their Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

# Projects
# Proj#1 - NBA Data Wrangling & Exploration
For this project, I am mainly interested in conducting data exploration and analysis on the offensive stats and characteristics of different NBA teams based on Finals ranking which is a new column I will create that contains 4 values: Champion, Runner-Up, Knocked Out and Never Qualified. This project contains a total of 3 notebooks that describe the steps that I’ve taken; the skills that I’ve focused on in this project are data gathering via web-scraping, data cleaning and data exploration(analysis and visualization).

# Proj#2 - Financial Youtube Data Analysis & Exploration
For this project, I've decided to analyze various financial Youtube channels that I've been following; most of the channels talk about the stock market. If you've been watching Youtube, you often hear content creators telling you to like, comment, and subscribe to help promote their videos. While this might not necessarily be the case, it certainly is worth exploring to look for certain factors that may support this claim. That is exactly what I am going to be doing in this notebook, along with identifying trends among certain Youtube channels with a particular niche or topic.

The skills that I’ve focused on in this project are data gathering via Youtube API, data cleaning and data exploration(analysis and visualization). Additionally, there is a question that I’ve asked and answered using natural language processing skills such as tokenizing sentences.
